        Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
        Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
        recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader
        of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in
        Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens
        (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto:
        Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in
        Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
        Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen
        Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected
        in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American
        production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump
        magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television
        series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October
        2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which adapts
        material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran
        on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot
        also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations
        (OVAs). The franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading
        cards developed by several companies. The story of Naruto continues in
        Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way
        instead of following his father's.

      <p>
        A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf
        village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in
        the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth
        Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside
        the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the
        beast.[i] The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader
        of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being
        the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage
        forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the
        Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals
        the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect
        of his teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii] Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a
        ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and
        Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an
        experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja
        teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the
        villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing
        assassinations. After several missions, including a major one in the
        Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them
        to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known
        as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal,
        invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of
        the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and
        searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage
        instead.

        Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with
        Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed
        Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for
        their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting
        seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is
        now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi
        to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the
        Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors
        to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition
        that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins
        the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat
        several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills
        Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him,
        earning the village's respect and admiration. With Nagato's death, Tobi,
        disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces
        that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion
        powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The
        leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join
        forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a
        Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great
        Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of
        zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the
        war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village),
        but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the
        host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of
        Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head
        for the battlefield. During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is
        Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead.
        The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As
        Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that
        led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and
        rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However,
        Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess
        who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself
        to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well.
        Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the
        Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village
        system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after
        they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and
        reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons
        Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto
        marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next
        generation.
